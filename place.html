              <p>
                The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most iconic monuments in the world and a symbol of
                eternal love.
                Built in 1632 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, it is a stunning example
                of Mughal architecture,
                blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles. Made from gleaming white marble and adorned with intricate
                carvings and precious
                stones, the Taj Mahal attracts millions of visitors from around the globe. It is not just a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site, but also
                one of the Seven Wonders of the World, standing as a timeless tribute to love, beauty, and
                craftsmanship.

              <h3>India Gate</h3>
              <p>
                The India Gate, located in New Delhi, is a grand war memorial built to honor the soldiers of the Indian
                Army who lost their lives during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Designed by Sir Edwin
                Lutyens and inaugurated in 1931, the monument stands 42 meters tall and resembles the Arc de Triomphe in
                Paris. Beneath the arch lies the Amar Jawan Jyoti, an eternal flame added after the 1971 Indo-Pak war to
                commemorate unknown soldiers. Surrounded by lush lawns and a vibrant atmosphere, India Gate is not only
                a symbol of national pride but also a popular gathering place for locals and tourists alike.

              <h3>Red Fort</h3>
              <p>
                The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fort in Delhi that served as the main residence of
                the Mughal emperors for over 200 years. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648, the fort is named after its
                massive red sandstone walls that stretch over 2 kilometers. It showcases the brilliance of Mughal
                architecture, with intricate carvings, marble inlays, and beautiful gardens. The Red Fort holds great
                national significance, as the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag here every Independence
                Day. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it stands as a powerful symbol of India's rich history
                and cultural heritage.

              <p>
                The Howrah Bridge, also known as Rabindra Setu, is an iconic cantilever bridge that spans the Hooghly
                River in Kolkata, West Bengal. Opened in 1943, it connects the cities of Howrah and Kolkata and is one
                of the busiest bridges in the world, carrying over a hundred thousand vehicles and countless pedestrians
                daily. Made entirely of riveted steel, without the use of nuts or bolts, it is an engineering marvel of
                its time. More than just a structure, the Howrah Bridge is a symbol of Kolkata‚Äôs heritage, playing a
                central role in the city‚Äôs culture, economy, and identity.

              <p>
                The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is the most sacred place of worship for Sikhs,
                located in Amritsar, Punjab. Its stunning golden structure, surrounded by the holy Amrit Sarovar (pool
                of nectar), creates a serene and spiritual atmosphere. Built in the 16th century by Guru Arjan Dev Ji,
                the temple stands as a symbol of equality, peace, and devotion. Open to people of all faiths, the Golden
                Temple also hosts the world‚Äôs largest free community kitchen (Langar), serving over a hundred thousand

              <h3>Ajanta and Ellora Caves</h3>
              <p>The Ajanta and Ellora Caves, located in Maharashtra, are among the most remarkable ancient rock-cut
                monuments in India. The Ajanta Caves, dating back to the 2nd century BCE, are known for their exquisite
                Buddhist paintings and sculptures, showcasing the life of the Buddha. The Ellora Caves, carved between
                the 6th and 10th centuries CE, represent a unique blend of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain faiths, reflecting
                India‚Äôs religious harmony. The highlight of Ellora is the Kailasa Temple, a massive monolithic structure
                carved from a single rock. Both sites are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and stand as extraordinary
                examples of art, architecture, and spiritual devotion.</p>
